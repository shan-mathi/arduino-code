# infinite wall
A 2 wheeled bot connected to a single motor driver. It is positioned to move along an infinite wall always maintaining a distance of 10 cm. this is acheived by placing a ultrasonic sensor.
If the bot deviates then the differential speeds of the motors will align it in such a way that it maintains the same distance.
